## Question 1: Describe a difficult work situation and how did you overcome it
### Situation: 

When I just started my fellowship training 6 years ago, I was part of a research project that involved observing birth of ferrets and then observing their growth. When we initally proposed the study it did not seem very complicated and required regular follow up in the lab monitoring their progress.  However, the greatest challenge we faced was balancing our budget with the innate nature of the ferrets to cull their young at birth if they are too small, too many or too sickly. So we invariably lost a third of the litter this way.  

### Task: 

While this was a natural process, we realized that my study was getting affected since ferrets also needed longer periods of observation period than mice because of their complex development, and also had very little turnaround time frame within my years of fellowship.


### Action: 

After discussing with my mentors and going through several peer reviewed journals, it seems the best outcome was for me to intervene at birth and to dissuade the mother from culling her young.  So I had baby camera installs, same as I was using for monitoring my children at home, and I learned behavior skills of the ferret from our animal husbandary and veterinary staff to get qualified, and then helped assist the mother in birth of the child and resusitate those that she discarded. Since ferrets delivered frequently at night, I had to be in the lab very early in the morning, sometimes before my clinical duties to help this process. 

### Result:

I had very few ferret losses in the time frame of my fellowship, almost non existant.  I completed a review article about these challenges we faced and how I could overcome them by thinking outside the box.  The solution for most of us in the lab was that there was no way around the challenge since I was not a qualified vet to intervene, however with the right support of extensive ancillary team I could overcome these challenges. 

## Question 2: Why did you leave your last job

### Situation: 

I like to think that every one wants to improve life - either your own or that of others.  After I left animal research in the university, I started getting heavily involved in clinical research. Even in fellowship, I noted my passion emerging for monitoring clinical performance and reviewing outcomes of changes.  However, the most dreaded part of any clinical research is data collection, and I realized that I was spending 15 min for each patient to gather data that was already there in the computer system.  Or as an individual health provider I was spending a considerable amoount of time entering data.

However, all this was done in my time outside of clincial hours. This meant I had little time with my kids and family while ivariably doing less research than what I enjoy.

### Task:

I wanted to find the root cause of the problem and find way that would not just benefit me but also my colleagues.


### Action: 

Joining a bootcamp is just first step to understanding if working with computers is for me. 

### Result:
 
I want to continue adding to my skillset so that one day I will be able to take my skills to healthcare and to my colleagues and streamline their datagathering / collecting/ entering challenges.
